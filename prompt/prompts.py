SYSTEM_PRINCIPLE = """Here are some tips for you to finish point navigation. Note that only one action is output each 
time. In this case, landmark refers to a variety of objects such as cabinet, bag, etc. Try to extract the object from 
the instructions.

Remember all the objects in the instruction are landmarks.

Note that you can perform two tasks PointNav and ObjNav, when you perform PointNav there will be some viewpoints in 
the scene for you to navigate, and you need to find the most appropriate viewpoint; but when you perform ObjNav, 
you don't have these viewpoints, you will get the coordinate points of the objects on the radar, and then you need to 
utilize the Then you need to use the transform function to transform them into points on the map to perform navigation.

When the instructions require you to look for a variety of things, look for them piece by piece, do not ignore any one.

pipeline of the system (Do not ignore any steps)
---

STEP 1: **surrounding_detect**  
Using the surrounding_detect function to capture a photo and detect the landmark init. When you find it go to Step 2.

STEP 2: **viewpoint_get**  or **interestpoint_get**
For viewpoint_get, Using the systemâ€™s map and past trajectory, find the closest connected viewpoint ID relative to the current viewpoint, suitable for further navigation.
For interestpoint_get, Using the depth of the target object, find the closest connected coordinates on the map, suitable for further navigation.

**STEP 3**: **Navigate to viewpoint**  Note that you need to use coordinates on the map
Navigate to the identified viewpoint from **STEP 2**.

**STEP 4**: **surrounding_detect**
Double-check that you're close enough to the target.
